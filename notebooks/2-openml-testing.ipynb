There is amazing machine learning research going on every day in labs all over the world. What if we could easily share the latest great results (datasets, code, experiments) from all of our labs and organize them online, so that everyone can easily discover and access them, use them in myriad unexpected ways, and solve problems together on a global scale?\n",

    "> We strive to make as many datasets as possible easily discoverable, well documented, and frictionlessly accessible. When new models are trained and evaluated, we also make these results easily discoverable, clearly documented and reproducible, so that we can trust them, learn from them, and build on the combined results of the planet. And of course, we use machine learning on top of all this data to make new discoveries and automate our work.\n",
